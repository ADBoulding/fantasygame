[Town Square]
Town SquareStr = "You step out of a narrow side street and into the center of town. The square is about seven houses wide by thirteen houses long, and is paved in neatly-cut grey cobblestone. Milky limestone colonnades skirt the flanks of the square running parallel to each other and  perpendicular to the sea. The inland end of the square halts at the foot of an imposing three story palace whose thick stone walls and delicately barred windows drip with imperial authority. Over the palace's  roof you can just see the tip of the spire on the temple pyramid soaring in the distance. In front of the palace is a large fountain where sculpted bronze water spirits stand frozen in the midst of some strange game, while in exactly the same place on the opposite end a shallow amphitheater is set into the ground for announcement making, poetry reading , and the like. The sky has only just begun to thaw out of its pre-dawn blue and into a full island gold, but still the market is buzzing. Merchants are arranging all kinds of goods at their stalls in the colonnade, and haggling with traders driving wooden carts of fresh wares up from the docks. What do you do next?#";

[Shop]
ShopStr = "You enter a local shop; a dusty foot-worn hole in the wall off the main square. Warm light filters through the dry spice-laden air and strikes various woods, cloths, and paper packages giving the place a woolen, earthy glow. As your eyes adjust you see that the shelves are stuffed with tins, and the walls are covered in tools and bundles mounted on hooks. Three corners are spilling with crates and burlap sacks while a fourth bears a small oak counter, and the floor between is a maze of barrels and parcels. Your footsteps are crisp and sonorous on the wooden planks beneath you as you approach the counter, stepping carefully so as not to topple the tightly packed merchandise. You hail the shop keeper who is preoccupied by a bundle of swords he is sorting in the back where they won't tempt any desperate thieving hands.#";
