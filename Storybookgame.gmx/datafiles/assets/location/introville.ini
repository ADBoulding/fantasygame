intro = 
"You stand at an immense wooden gate in the middle of a vast and empty plain.#
Looking up, you try to recall how you arrived, or what you were doing prior, but only emptiness stands.#
As you try to gain your bearings in the situation, you hear a noise from behind you. Turning around, you're startled to find#
an old man standing not ten feet away from you, bearing a large grin. \"Hello,\" the old man says, his gnarled features forming around the corners#
of his upturned mouth, \"welcome to Introville, land of beginnings and needlessly long tutorials.#\""
